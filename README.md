# Logistic_Regression (Cat Image Detection)

Implementing Logistic Regression using numpy. No frame work used. We implement the model to find cat vs non-cat images with an accuracy of more than 70% (Logistic Regression...DUH!!)

Inspired hugely from Andrew Ng's Course codes. Huge shout out to whole team. Amaizing job in teaching this.
